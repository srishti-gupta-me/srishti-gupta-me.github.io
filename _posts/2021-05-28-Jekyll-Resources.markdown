This is a resource directory I used to create a page like this. Refer to them in order or as you like. 

Firstly, building a Jekyll Github Page took me quite sometime even when I had some HTML and CSS experience. I faced a lot of issues, and particularly that my webpage was developing fine locally but not on Github Pages.

[Mike Dane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsYqPL9EFwQ) I learnt mostly from his videos and then [CSS Vanish](https://github.community/t/css-not-being-applied-in-pages/10466) learnt the other problems that might be the root cause for the failures. 


[To embed files](https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/html/how-to-embed-pdf-in-html.html) like pdfs 


[How to delete Git Repository](https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/git/how-to-delete-git-repository-created-with-init.html) . This was also my first experience working with git and I created many repositories and ended up deleting all and restarted the whole process.

I have been trying to upload favicon to my webpage. Well what is Favicon??<br>A favicon, also known as a shortcut icon, website icon, tab icon, URL icon, or bookmark icon, is a file containing one or more small icons, associated with a particular website or web page.<br> So the small image or icon on the leftmost side of the tab that you can see (is my image). <br> It took me more than 24 hours distributed over days to implement it.<br>Understanding was easier, but in my case the solution given online weren't working. Once I was able to get the Favicon , but the whole CSS vanished.Will explain reason behind this.<br>
