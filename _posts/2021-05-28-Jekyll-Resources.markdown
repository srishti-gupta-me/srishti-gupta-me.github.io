Firstly, building a Jekyll Github Page took me quite sometime even when I had some HTML and CSS experience. I faced a lot of issues, and particularly that my webpage was developing fine locally but not on Github Pages.

[Mike Dane](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gsYqPL9EFwQ) I learnt mostly from his videos and then [CSS Vanish](https://github.community/t/css-not-being-applied-in-pages/10466) learnt the other problems that might be the root cause for the failures.

[How to delete Git Repository](https://www.w3docs.com/snippets/git/how-to-delete-git-repository-created-with-init.html) . This was also my first experience working with git and I created many repositories and ended up deleting all and restarted the whole process.
