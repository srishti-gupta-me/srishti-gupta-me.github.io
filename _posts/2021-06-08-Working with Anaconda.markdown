I am learning to work with Nbdev. 

One of the requirement is to install Anaconda and run nbdev library from the save server where Jupyter Notebook is running. 

It required installing Anaconda, and I followed the documentation available on the site as it is. 

Helpful resources :

[Anaconda Cheetsheat](https://kapeli.com/cheat_sheets/Conda.docset/Contents/Resources/Documents/index)

To come out of Conda completely: <em>conda deactivate</em>, one of the most useful commands I found.
