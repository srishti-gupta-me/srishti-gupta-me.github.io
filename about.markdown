I worked as a Fleet Performance Engineer with [Alstom](https://www.alstom.com/) for 2.8 years before moving to work with [Trivedi Centre for Political Data](https://tcpd.ashoka.edu.in/) at Ashoka University as Junior Research Fellow. At Alstom, I worked with locomotives in analysing data and driving insights that helped business in taking key decisions. Recently, I have been exploring Deep Learning and working on projects.I am working througn the Fast.ai course. 

At TCPD, I am working on building public database for municipal elections in India which is a collaboration with [CASI, UPenn](https://casi.sas.upenn.edu/) and another project soon to be announced!

I also have experience working with nonprofits in various capacity: writing grants, research & analysis, and community outreach.
